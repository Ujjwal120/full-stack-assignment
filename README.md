# Assignment for Full Stack Developer

### Completed the assignment !

* I have built both frontend and backend for the complettion of this assignment.
* The site has 3 tabs namely : Nature(default) , Tech, Festival.
* Unsplash API has restriction on the number of requests that a demo application is allowed to have
* As a result i had to figure out a way to ensure the infinite scrolling, which i did by making 2 keys for each tab that i made.
* Thus allowing about 3000 pics to be retrieved on the fly as we scroll down the page for each tab.
* I have immplemented a way that keep tracks of the amount of scrolling that have been done so far and accordingly make request to my express app which is my backend.
* I have ensured the security and have followed the right guidelines to use the Third Party API Unsplash.
* No direct calls/requests are made from frontend, rather my backend handles the requests.
* The backend is hosted on Herroku.
* I tried to cover the feel of the website provided as a demo as much as i could in the given period of time.
* I wanted to add more animations and stuff but due to the lack of time settled for this.
